When talking about a "bitstream" for a Spartan-6 FPGA,
one must specify, whether one is talking about:
* a Xilinx bitfile,
* a Configuration Command Sequence or
* a file storing Configuration Memory Frames, which can be
  * in binary or
  * in ASCII representation.

Here the term bitstream will be used for the Configuration Command Sequence.
