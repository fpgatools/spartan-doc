# FPGA design flow

...how it is realised in the YoSys + Arachne + iCEstorm toolchain
and
how it could be realised for the Xilinx Spartan-6 toolchain.

## Synthesis

Synthesis in general compiles a **hardware description** language
to a netlist of **logic primitives**, e.g. LUTs and D-Flipflops,
and proceeds by **mapping** those primitives to device-specific primitives, e.g. SB_LUT4 for iCE40 FPGAs.
Amongst other things,
YoSys is capable of compiling Verilog
to most of the primitives that are available in Lattice iCE40-FPGAs.
The output of the synthesis is the netlist
containing a list of FPGA tiles with (abstract) configuration
alongside information about how to interconnect the inputs and outputs of those tiles.

Excerpt from a BLIF netlist generated by YoSys:
```blif
...
.gate SB_LUT4 I0=mysignal1 I1=mysignal2 I2=mysignal3 I3=mysignal4 O=myderivedsignal
.param LUT_INIT 0000111110111011
...
```
The above example shows the BLIF representation of an iCE40 lookup table (SB_LUT4)
as it was generated by YoSys.
The above LUT gets four inputs signals (I0-4) and provides one output signal (O).
In the second line the corresponding lookup table values are configured
(which determine how the output signal is logically derived from the input signals).

The outputs of a primitive are input to one or several others.
The totality of interconnected primitives
realizes the desired logical flow.
Tile interconnections are thereby called nets.
Nets can only represent one signal
and thus only have one logical/electrical value at a time,
but they can connect two or more inputs with one output.
Nets are identified by their name.
Some net names are derived from the design source and therefore human-readable,
others are generated by the synthesis tool to interconnect infered tiles.
