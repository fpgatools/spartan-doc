# This project

The aim of this project is to generate
a complete Open Source software toolchain
for the compilation of Verilog to bitstreams for Spartan-6 FPGAs.

A lot of work has already been done by Wolfgang Spraul.
The aim is to start with his work and integrate it with
existing FPGA tools,
like the one for Lattice iCE40 FPGAs (YoSys+Arachne-PnR+iCEstorm),
VPR,
OpenPR,
qFlow,
tFlow,
RapidSmith
and/or
TORC.
